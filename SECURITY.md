## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/scryncloud/security-scan-action/security/advisories/new) (private by default). This allows us to discuss and fix the issue before it is disclosed.

**Alternative:** Email security concerns to the maintainers (see contact details on [scryn.cloud](https://scryn.cloud)).

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. We will acknowledge your report and work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline.
